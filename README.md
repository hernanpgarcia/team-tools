# Team Tools Dashboard

A Flask-based web application providing statistical tools for A/B testing and data analysis. This toolkit offers comprehensive solutions for sample size calculations, sequential testing, and standard deviation estimation.

## Features

### ðŸ§® Sample Size Calculator (Fixed Horizon)
Calculate required sample sizes for traditional A/B tests with fixed endpoints.
- Supports both absolute and relative improvement scenarios
- Configurable statistical power (80%, 90%, etc.) and significance levels
- Handles unknown standard deviation with robust estimation
- Provides confidence intervals for effect sizes
- Uses Welch's T-test framework for reliable results

### ðŸ”„ Sequential Testing (mSPRT)
Plan experiments that can be stopped early when results become conclusive.
- Mixed Sequential Probability Ratio Test (mSPRT) framework
- Continuous monitoring without alpha inflation issues
- Efficiency gains through early stopping
- Robust variance handling for unknown standard deviations
- Generates monitoring plans with decision boundaries

### ðŸ“Š Standard Deviation Calculator
Comprehensive tools for estimating and calculating standard deviations when data is limited.
- Calculate from raw data points
- Estimate from min/max ranges using multiple methods
- Derive from percentiles (quartiles) for better accuracy
- Specialized conversion rate standard deviation calculations
- Sample size requirements for standard deviation estimation

## Use Cases

- **Product Teams**: A/B test planning and analysis
- **Data Scientists**: Statistical power analysis and sample size determination
- **Researchers**: Sequential experiment design and monitoring
- **Analysts**: Standard deviation estimation from limited data

## Technical Implementation

The application uses a modular architecture with separated concerns:
- Flask handles web routing and user interface
- Mathematical calculations are isolated in dedicated modules
- Templates provide a clean, responsive user experience
- Error handling ensures robust user feedback

All statistical calculations are implemented from scratch using fundamental mathematical principles, ensuring transparency and customizability for specific use cases.
